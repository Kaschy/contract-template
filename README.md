# Creative Services Agreement Template

For making fancy contracts in markdown.

This is the template and style I use for writing and editing consulting contracts. The contract is forked from [Contract Killer](https://gist.github.com/malarkey/4031110) and the CSS is designed to be used with [MacDown](https://github.com/uranusjr/macdown) markdown editor.


## What it looks like

## Required

* [MacDown](https://github.com/uranusjr/macdown)
* [Montserrat](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/montserrat) (for headlines)
* [PT Serif](http://www.paratype.com/public/) (for body copy)


## How to use

* Download [MacDown](https://github.com/uranusjr/macdown)
* Download or clone this repo
* Move `Contracts.css` to `~/Library/Application Support/MacDown/Styles`
* Set Contracts as the style to use in Rendering
* Open `Creative Services Agreement.md` in MacDown and make changes to suit your needs
* Export to PDF (`⌥⌘P`)
* Enjoy your ✨pretty✨ contracts


## Things of note

* The date and signature line styles rely on the date immediately following the line.
* You don't *have* to use MacDown if you don't want to. It's entirely possible to edit the contract in any markdown editor that exports HTML. Simply open the exported HTML, add a link to `Contracts.css` and print to PDF from the browser (though it may render differently).
* Browser support for print styles are very inconsistent. If avoiding page breaks is important, print from Firefox. However, then `orphans` and `widows` no longer work. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
